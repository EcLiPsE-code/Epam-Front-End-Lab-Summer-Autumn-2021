# Task 4

You have to add state management of your application with Redux

1. You need to implement action creators for albums, photos
2. You need to implement reducers for albums, photos, user
3. You need to review you components and 'connect' store with application
4. You need to add buttons "Add album" and "Add photo" after last items in corresponding lists.
Clicking on this button must add new items with hardcoded values

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Considering limitations in API that it does not add new items
into list of albums or photos (it`s only return "OK" status), u need to think about
how u should save new items. I propose u to use special field in reducer for new items,
created locally. Resulted list for components should combine items from API
and local added items. But you can to discuss with you mentor and find more suitable solution if you want.
**The main target of this task - move out of components bussiness logic with storing and
creating items with redux.**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
