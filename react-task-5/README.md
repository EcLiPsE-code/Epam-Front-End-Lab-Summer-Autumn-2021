# Task 5

You have to need add forms for creating new album and photos

1. Instead if creating hardcoded albums and photos you need to show
modal window with necessary fields. Modal window must be independent
component and can be used separately with different content. UI must include
minimum number of features (see the pictures). Try to use features that we
mentioned in lecture (context or renderProps for content, portal for placement of modal window, or your own ideas)/
implements simple validation

2. Add ErrorBoundary to your application
3. As we can have a lot of items from API response, we need to have
a way to go to bottom of page. So you need to add a control inside of 
<Content \/> component that will scroll to bottom of page on click (any UI for this control)

**Additional task:** as we don`t touch topic how to implement custom hooks, try to implement:
1. Hook to get previous value of props, state, etc
usePrevious(value)
2. Hook that will repeat behavior of component componentDidUnmount lifecycle method useComponentDidUnmount(callback)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
